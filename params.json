{"name":"Php-mysql-login","tagline":"Connection with PDO for accessing different database","body":"Hello!\r\nIn this context I present how to access a database via PDO connexion.\r\nYou will find the necessary files for registration and a file to connect and also a script to the database.\r\n# PDO advantage over Mysqli\r\n\r\n## It's a cinch to connect to a database with both of these:\r\n\r\n// PDO\r\n>$pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=localhost;dbname=database\", 'username', 'password');\r\n \r\n// mysqli, procedural way\r\n>$mysqli = mysqli_connect('localhost','username','password','database');\r\n \r\n// mysqli, object oriented way\r\n>$mysqli = new mysqli('localhost','username','password','database');\r\n\r\nThe core advantage of PDO over MySQLi is in its database driver support. At the time of this writing, PDO supports 12 different drivers, opposed to MySQLi, which supports MySQL only.\r\n\r\nTo print a list of all the drivers that PDO currently supports, use the following code:\r\n\r\n>var_dump(PDO::getAvailableDrivers());\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? Well, in situations when you have to switch your project to use another database, PDO makes the process transparent. So all you'll have to do is change the connection string and a few queries - if they use any methods which aren't supported by your new database. With MySQLi, you will need to rewrite every chunk of code - queries included.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nContact me https://github.com/tojorodialson or tojorodialson@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
